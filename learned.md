# Git Stuff!

I already have used Git quite a bit, but in a fairly limited and non-technical way... Getting the terminalogy straight (and using with VS code more reliably) is especially useful.  


# Pulls

I had heard of them, but didn't know what they were until just now. I have had teammates submit pull requests to me in other classes for repo merges, and I was kinda able to figure them out on the fly, but actually understanding what they are under the hood helps.

# VS Code Integration

I have used Git with VS Code before, but I could never get it to work quite right except for a single time, when it accidently worked...
